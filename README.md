## The Condition

You are developing an application in which you must implement external communication using the MQTT protocol.
The application is needed to be deployed on a Linux-based machine, specifically CentOS.
And due to the limitation given by the owner of the server, you are only given specific permissions, and therefore some action may be prohibited.

## The Problem

It worked actually and running well on your machine. However, when you deploy it to production,
it fails with an unknown error every time you try to connect and/or publish messages.

## The Objective

Implement a sample subscription and publishing function within the application. Find the issue and fix it.

_You may be able to replicate the issue by running it in a container like Docker._

## The Expected Result

The application could run without error, on any occassion.
